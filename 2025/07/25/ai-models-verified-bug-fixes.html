              We have submitted a new article
              <a href="/publications/do-ai-models-help-produce-verified-fixes"
                >Do AI models help produce verified bugs?</a
              >
              for publication. It analyses how and when software engineers
              profit (or not) from using LLMs in working with verified software.
            </p>

            <p>
              The paper is authored by <a href="/people/li-huang">Li Huang</a>,
              <a href="/people/ilgiz-mustafin">Ilgiz Mustafin</a>,
              <a href="/people/marco-piccioni">Marco Piccioni</a>,
              <a href="/people/alessandro-schena">Alessandro Schena</a>,
              <a href="/people/reto-weber">Reto Weber</a>,
              <a href="/people/bertrand-meyer">Bertrand Meyer</a>. Also, 25
              software engineers contributed their time and effort as the
              experiment participants. I thank all participants for their work!
            </p>

            <p>
              We asked the experiment participants to fix bugs in 9 programs.
              Participants were split into two groups: 10 participants were
              allowed to use AI and 15 participants were not allowed to use AI
              during the experiment. Each participant had 2 hours for the tasks
              and had to record the video of their screen for the further
              analysis. The 50 hours of video recordings were manually analysed
              by the authors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Participants used the AutoProof verifier to check the correctness
              of the fixes, in contrast with the usual practice of running tests
              or manual inspection of the code.
            </p>

            <p>
              I think this paper highlights an promising approach of combining a
              very informal vibe-coding (vibe-debugging here) and the use of
              formal methods (static verification).
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, I was happy to introduce some of my friends to the program
              verification tools in general and AutoProof in particular. Thanks
              again for taking part in the experiment!
