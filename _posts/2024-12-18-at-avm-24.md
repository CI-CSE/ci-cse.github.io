title: At the 16th Alpine Verification Meeting (AVM’24)
---
In September 2024 our team participated
in the [16th Alpine Verification Meeting (AVM’24)][avm24] which took place
in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.

Recently, organisers of AVM’24 sent out photos from the event, so it is
a good opportunity to write this blog post.

This three-day meeting was organised by [Dominik Klumpp][dominik],
[Matthias Heizmann][matthias] and
[Andreas Podelski][andreas] from the [Software Engineering group][sw]
at the [University of Freiburg][uni].

At the event we presented our ongoing research and discussed projects
with other participants.

Ilgiz Mustafin talked about his work on the extension of the approach
from the recently published
paper [The Concept of Class Invariant in Object-oriented Programming]({% link _publications/concept-of-class-invariant-in-oop.md %}) written
earlier at the Chair.

Alessandro Schena presented his analysis of class invariants of various
data structures. He showed how data structures can be organised
into an inheritance structure supported by the inherited class invariants.
