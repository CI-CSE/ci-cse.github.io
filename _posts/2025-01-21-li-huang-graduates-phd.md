title: Li Huang completes her PhD
author: ilgiz-mustafin

Last week on January 13th [Li Huang][li] defended her PhD thesis!
She will get a double
PhD degree from [Constructor Institute of Technology][inst] and from [Constructor University][uni].

Her work on verification counterexamples made the biggest everyday improvement
in my daily work in AutoProof.
The counterexample work was described in
[Improving Counterexample Quality from Failed Program Verification][ce]
and later papers. I cannot imagine writing verified software without
seeing the exact counterexamples of failed verifications.
