title: At the Swiss Verification Day 2025

On February 13th we have joined the [Swiss Verification Day 2025][svd] workshop
at the [UniversitaÌ€ della Svizzera italiana][usi] in Lugano, Switzerland.

The workshop was organized by [Carlo A. Furia][furia],
[Natasha Sharygina][sharygina] and [Roberto Minelli][minelli] from USI.

It was refreshing to look at so many different approaches and applications
for formal methods and verification during one day. Some talks presented
verification tools for various languages such as C, Rust, Go and Solidity.
Other talks were about the lower-level topics such as SMT solvers
and alternative logics.

For me, one of the most memorable talks was the talk by [Can Cebeci][cebeci]
about
a C static verification tool called [TPot][tpot]. Because TPot is focused
on verifiying parts of systems written in C,
a special set of trade-offs can be chosen to sacrifice a bit of verification
time in favor of decrease of required annotations.

Between the talks we had the opportunity to exchange the research and teaching
experience with students and researches from other Swiss universities.
