[Bertrand Meyer][bm] and [Reto Weber][rw] have published an extended and revised version of the [theory of programs][top], now called [PRISM][pm]. 
This work involved a complete rework from the ground up, refining definitions and, 
most importantly, rigorously proving the claims presented in the paper.

We replaced previously disproven theorems with correct formulations and provided a precise definition of concurrency. 
Additionally, during our research, we encountered the concept of "Choice Normal Form" (CNF), 
which proved valuable for establishing various properties and describing numerous behaviors.

I thoroughly enjoyed working on the proofs using Isabelle/HOL and will continue contributing to this project in the future.
