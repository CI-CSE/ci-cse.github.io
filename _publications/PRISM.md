  A re-construction of the fundamentals of programming as a small mathematical theory (PRISM) based on elementary set theory. Highlights:
    ∙ Zero axioms. No properties are assumed, all are proved (from standard set theory).
    ∙ A single concept covers specifications and programs.
    ∙ Its definition only involves one relation and one set.
    ∙ Everything proceeds from three operations: choice, composition and restriction.
    ∙ These techniques suffice to derive the axioms of classic papers on the "laws of programming" as consequences and prove them mechanically.
    ∙ The ordinary subset operator suffices to define both the notion of program correctness and the concepts of specialization and refinement.
    ∙ From this basis, the theory deduces dozens of theorems characterizing important properties of programs and programming.
    ∙ All these theorems have been mechanically verified (using Isabelle/HOL); the proofs are available in a public repository.
    This paper is a considerable extension and rewrite of an earlier [contribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00723).
