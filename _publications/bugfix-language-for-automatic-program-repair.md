abstract: |
  Techniques of Automatic Program Repair (APR) have the potential of thoroughly
  facilitating the task of producing quality software. After a promising start,
  however, progress in making APR practical has been hindered by the lack of
  a common framework to support the multiplicity of APR ideas and tools,
  and of target programming languages and environments.
  In this position paper we outline a general framework to enable the APR
  community to benefit from each other's advances, in particular through
  a standard language for describing bugs and their fixes.
  Such a common framework --- which is also applicable to work on fault
  seeding --- could be a tremendous benefit to researchers and developers of
  Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) who are working to make APR
  an effective part of the software developer's practical experience.
