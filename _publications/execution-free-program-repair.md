abstract: |
  Automatic program repair usually relies heavily on test cases for both
  bug identification and fix validation.
  The issue is that writing test cases is tedious, running them takes much time,
  and validating a fix through tests does not guarantee its correctness.
  The novel idea in the Proof2Fix methodology and tool presented here is to rely
  instead on a program prover, without the need to run tests or to run
  the program at all.
  Results show that Proof2Fix automatically finds and
  fixes significant historical bugs.
