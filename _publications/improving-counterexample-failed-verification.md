abstract: |
    In software verification, a successful automated program proof is the
    ultimate triumph. The road to such success is, however, paved with many
    failed proof attempts. The message produced by the prover when a proof fails
    is often obscure, making it very hard to know how to proceed further.
    The work reported here attempts to help in such cases by providing
    immediately understandable counterexamples. To this end, it introduces
    an approach called Counterexample Extraction and Minimization (CEAM).
    When a proof fails, CEAM turns the counterexample model generated by the prover
    into a a clearly understandable version; it can in addition simplify the
    counterexamples further by minimizing the integer values they contain.
    We have implemented the CEAM approach as an extension to the AutoProof verifier
    and demonstrate its application to a collection of examples.
