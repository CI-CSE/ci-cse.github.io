abstract: |
  The technology of formal software verification has made spectacular advances,
  but how much does it actually benefit the development of practical software?
  Considerable disagreement remains about the practicality of building systems
  with mechanically-checked proofs of correctness.
  Is this prospect confined to a few expensive, life-critical projects,
  or can the idea be applied to a wide segment of the software industry?
  To help answer this question, the present survey examines a range of projects,
  in various application areas, that have produced formally verified systems
  and deployed them for actual use. It considers the technologies used,
  the form of verification applied, the results obtained, and the
  lessons that the software industry should draw regarding
  its ability to benefit from formal verification techniques and tools.

  Note: this version is the extended article, covering all the systems identified as relevant. A shorter version, covering only a selection, is also available.
